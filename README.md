To install dependencies:

```bash
bun run start

## Motivation

This project was created to share memes and jokes with friends.

I have decided to keep things simple because I wanted to use htmx and do things the traditional way.

## Architecture 

- Session is persisted and mainted using cookies without any external libraries
  
- Responses are sent as HTML components from server which are then handled by HTMX on client'

## Features
  - Users can make post and delete them when they want
  - Write comments on other's post, like, disklike

Simple and Minimal
